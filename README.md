# CS 406 Frontend

## Getting Started

This is an node based react application. To get started, clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Dependencies
- Node.js
- install gcloud cli
- login to gcloud with `gcloud auth login`
- set project with `gcloud config set project cs406-project-483720`

## Setting up the Environment
This project requires use of a Google Cloud account and the Google Cloud cli. More information on setting up the Google Cloud cli can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Note
I’m not certain which Google packages are required to run this app locally. My environment already has the necessary dependencies installed from previous projects that used Google Cloud services.

## Backend
The api code can be found in the following repository: [CS 406 API](https://github.com/pdxgrantc/CS406-api)
